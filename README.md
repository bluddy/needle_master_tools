# NEEDLE MASTER TOOLS

THis project contains the Python and C++ versions of the MATLAB tools I wrote to read Needle Master demonstrations.

The goals of this code are to make sure we generate a reliable set of features across different languages. This version should be more concise and more portable.

Note that the C++ code will only require Boost, so it is fully portable to Windows. That doesn't mean that I will be writing code to support building on Windows immediately, but it should happen eventually.
